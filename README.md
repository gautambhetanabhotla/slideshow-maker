This is a web app built by Arya Mahendraker, Ananthula Sai Ravichandra and myself as part of our course project for the course:
**CS6.201: Introduction to software systems**

This app works on the following frameworks and technologies:
- Flask
- CockroachDB
- JWT
- MoviePY
- EXIF
- Bootstrap

and more.

This app lets you upload images onto your online gallery and make a slideshow out of selected ones.
